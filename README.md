## Description
This project involves a simple yet professional website designed for a family member's business. It showcases my skills in creating visually appealing and user-friendly website interfaces.

## Technologies Used

- Calendly Integration: Allows for easy appointment scheduling directly on the website.

Key Learnings
- Design Complexity: The process of crafting designs that are both appealing and functional took much longer than initially anticipated, underscoring the importance of dedicating sufficient time to the design phase.
- Integration Insights: Gained a deep understanding of Calendly's settings and explored alternative calendar systems like Acuity.
